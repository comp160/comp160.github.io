## Introduction:
Median of medians is a deterministic recursive rank finding algorithm that will find the ith smallest
element within an array. More formally Median of Medians has the following interface:

$$
\text{Given an array A = [1,...,n], of n numbers and an index i, } 1 \leq i \leq n \text{ find the i}^{th} \text{ smallest in A}
$$
