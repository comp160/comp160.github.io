## Introduction:
Median of medians is a deterministic recursive rank finding algorithm that will find the ith smallest
element within an array. More formally Median of Medians has the following interface:

$$
\text{Given an array A = [1,...,n], of n numbers and an index i, } 1 \leq i \leq n \text{ find the i}^{th} \text{ smallest element in A}
$$

The algorithm presented in lecture runs in $$O(n)$$ time, and is **deterministic** because it is guaranteed 
to terminate in $$O(n)$$ time.

**Note:** Despite being named median of medians, this algorithm can find any ranks element.

## A Trivial approach to rank finding
Before diving into the rank finding algorithm, lets first observe a slightly slower implementation of
a rank finder. The slow approach first involves sorting the list, followed by indexing into the desired
rank. The code is as follows:
~~~ python
    """
        Args:
        A (List[Int]): An array containing numbers
        i (Int): The rank 

        Returns:
        Int: the ith smallest element in A
    """
    def slowRankFinding(A, i):
        sortedA = sorted(A)
        return sortedA[i] 
      
~~~

The reason this algorithm is slower is because we have to sort. If you recall, the best we can do with *comparison* based sorting is $$\Theta(n\log n)$$. The next natural question becomes, can I do better? After all we're sorting an entire array for just 1 value. The answer is naturally yes.

## The Algorithm
At a higher level, given an array $$A$$ we'll be splitting this array into smaller
sized arrays and computing representative medians. Afterwards we'll aggregate those representative medians into another array (call this $$A_1$$) and compute the median of that representative array. Keep in mind we will be using the **exact same** rank finding function to compute $$A_1$$'s median. It might sound counter intuitive at first, but we're just using a median finding function to find the median of a smaller array. Ultimately, after finding the median of $$A_1$$, we'll use $$A_1$$'s median to pivot our array, and in turn attempt to gauge where the $$i^{th}$$ smallest element is. More formally:

1. Divide array $$A$$ into subarrays each containing 5 elements. (We have $$\frac{n}{5}$$ arrays of length 5)
2. Sort these subarrays and find their medians.
3. Collect the medians into a different array and recursively compute the median of that array. (Effectively compute the median of an array of size $$\frac{n}{5}$$)
4. Using the just computed median (call this $$m_1$$), pivot the original array $$A$$ call this resultant array $$A_{\text{pivoted}}$$.
5. $$m_1$$ has some rank $$k$$ within $$A_{\text{pivoted}}$$. $$k$$ may or may not be the *true* median of $$A_{\text{pivoted}}$$, similarly $$k$$ may or may not be the $$i^{th}$$ smallest element we're looking for. All we know now is everything to left of $$m_1$$ is smaller than $$m_1$$ and everything to right of $$m_1$$ is greater than $$m_1$$. It follows from the previous statement that **if** $$A$$ were sorted, then $$m_1$$ is in the same position in both sorted $$A$$ and $$A_{\text{pivoted}}$$.
6. 
   a) if $$k == i$$ we've found the $$i^{th}$$ smallest element and we're done.

       b) if $$k > i$$ the element in question exists to the left of our pivot, recurse to the left of our pivot and search for the $$i^{th}$$ rank.

       c) if $$k < i$$ the element in question exists to the right of our pivot, recurse to the right of our pivot and search for the $$(i-k)^{th}$$ rank.

Sometimes it's more helpful to see the code of the algorithm in question. In python the above algorithm is as follows. [Credits to Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/median-finding-algorithm/)

~~~ python
def median_of_medians(A, i):

    #Step 1) divide A into subarray of len 5
    subarrays = [A[j:j+5] for j in range(0, len(A), 5)]
    #Step 2) find the medians of those subarrays
    medians = [sorted(subarray)[len(subarray)/2] for subarray in subarrays]
    #Step 3) Recursively compute the median of the array containing medians
    if len(medians) <= 5:
        pivot = sorted(medians)[len(medians)/2]
    else:
        #the pivot is the median of the medians
        pivot = median_of_medians(medians, len(medians)/2)

    #Step 4) Partition A around pivot
    low = [j for j in A if j < pivot]
    high = [j for j in A if j > pivot]

    #Step 5) Find the rank of the pivot. Below is a hacky 
    # way of computing the rank of the pivot. We use the length
    # of the array containing numbers less than
    # the pivot to determine this.
    k = len(low)
    #Step 6 b) The rank k is less than desired rank
    if i < k:
        return median_of_medians(low,i)
    #Step 6 c) The rank k is greater than desired rank
    elif i > k:
        return median_of_medians(high,i-k-1)
    #Step 6 a) We were lucky and computed the desired rank
    else: 
        return pivot

## Time Complexity analysis

To come up with a recurrence for this algorithm, we should dissect its components,
based on the steps outlined in the previous section:

1. Dividing $$A$$ into subarrays would take $$\Theta(n)$$ since we need to iterate through
all elements in $$A$$ &#8594; this step takes $$\Theta(n)$$
2.
